    "__Note:__ For all of our analyses, we are planning to normalize any data points that we use so that they can be compared more easily. Additionally we may try to create a standard metric for each aspect that we are looking at (hitting, pitching, and fielding). wRC+ is a standardized metric with a mean of 100 for a given season, so we will probably use this for offense and then make it a standard normal to better work with the rest of the data."

    "We want to see if the effect of certain statistics on winning percentage changes over time. Specifically, we want to see if offense has become more or less important for winning since 2006 and if pitching has become more or less important for hitting. We know that we've seen HR numbers and other power numbers increase along with strikeouts. We want to see if these changes are related to a change in the game. So are HR more valuable today (from 2019 data) than they were in 2006?One analysis that we are going to run to determine this is to develop a regression model that illustrates the affect of home runs on winning percentage in 2006, and then in 2019. We are going to use hypothesis testing to see if these coefficients from our regression are statistically different. We are hoping to find a way to expand this model so that we can look at changes over time using all of the years in our dataset (2006-2019). This would entail creating a regression for, in this case, winning percentage on HR for each year. Then we would try to figure out if there is a discernable trend in the coefficients. Our theory is that those coefficients are increasing, which is to say HR are becoming more important for winning percentage."
