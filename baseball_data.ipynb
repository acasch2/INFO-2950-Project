    "1. In the post-steroid era, were the most successful teams built with elite hitting, pitching, or fielding? Basically based on data that represents quality, is it more valuable to score runs or prevent runs? Is a run scored really the same as a run prevented?\n",
    "2. Although all of this data is from the same \"era,\" there is no doubt that the game has changed within this era, does data support the idea that the make-up of the most successful teams has changed in the last 15 years or so? (By make-up we mean, for example, has hitting become more important?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is some research on these topics most of the it is outdated or purely looking at the run totals or basic stats that are widely regarded as not being great measures of actual quality of a player (i.e., batting average). We want to look and see if beyond just runs, quality offense, quality pitching, or quality fielding is more valuable for a team's success (i.e., OPS for hitting or FIP for pitching)."

    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents one season for one Major League Baseball team. The seasons range from 2006 to 2019. Each of the 30 MLB teams has data for each of these years, making a total of 420 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each column represents a particular baseball statistic, averaged or summed over all players on a team. For example, the `hit_hr` column represents the total number of homeruns hit by a team in a season. The columns include information on hitting, pitching, and fielding as well as a couple measurements of overall team performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why was this dataset created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We created this dataset to aggregate various team statistics for all Major League Baseball teams from 2006 to 2019. Our dataset contains data not only about one aspect of baseball (i.e., pitching, fielding, or hitting), but combines information about all of these aspects into one dataset. We chose to take data starting in 2006 because it is considered to be the first season in the start of the \"Post-Steroid Era\" according to Dr. Michael Woltring et al. in [_The Sport Journal_](https://thesportjournal.org/article/examining-perceptions-of-baseballs-eras/). Although there is data from the 2020 season, that season was shortened and there were some rule changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so we decided to end our dataset with the 2019 season. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data which makes up our dataset comes from [fangraphs.com](fangraphs.com), a baseball statistics and analytics website. FanGraphs is funded by individual membership subscriptions, and collects and maintains their data for fans. Their website provides ways for users to filter data by team, year, and other aspects in order for users to easily compare data of interest. FanGraphs obtains their data from various sources. According to their website, \"All major league baseball data including pitch type, velocity, batted ball location, and play-by-play data provided by Sports Info Solutions;\" and \"Major League and Minor League Baseball data provided by Major League Baseball.\"\n",

    "In general, Major League Baseball, Sports Info Solutions, and by proxy FanGraphs are very thorough in their data collection as they include all games for all teams in their data. Due to the nature of the availability of data in baseball in the twenty-first century, the data observed should be complete and unbiased. This means that the information that is missing is largely in data we have chosen to omit or were unable to include or which are unmeasurable. For example, we did not include any statistics that require technology to gather (for example statcast data like exit velocity). This will limit what data we can look at, however this data is not available across the entire era that we are looking at and so we decided we wanted to focus on statistics that are collected (or calculated) in the more traditional way. The biggest influence on the data which we haven't measured is park effects for certain teams. For example, the Colorado Rockies play half their games at Coors Field, which is at altitude, every season. Therefore, they might have more offense and their pitchers might allow more runs just because of where they are. However, we would expect to still be able to see whether their pitching or hitting was more important using stats like run differential or win percentage. Nevertheless, parks with these extreme effects could definitely be outliers and our data does not have information account for this.\n",

    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing that was done is described in more detail in our Data Cleaning section. However, here is a summary. We downloaded 8 `.csv` files from [fangraphs.com](fangraphs.com): 3 for hitting, 3 for pitching, and 2 for fielding. Each of these `.csv` files contained 420 observations, one for each Major League Baseball team across the years 2006 - 2019. We dropped overlapping columns and those not needed for our data analysis, and renamed the remaining columns to make them more indicative of their contents and to eliminate ambiguity. Some of the team naming was inconsistent, so we also renaming some of the observations. We also changed some of the columns to numeric values from strings. Eventually, we combined information from all 8 dataframes together. \n",

    "\n",
    "The data does originate from people. However, the data in our data set is aggregated across entire Major League Baseball teams. Major League Baseball has a lot of data in the public domain and the baseball players who played in the games that generated this data were aware of the data collection. In general, players know that there is no limitation on what baseball data will be used for and are aware that it is generally intended for baseball research to learn about trends in the game and how players and teams compare to each other.\n",

    "### Data Limitations\n",
    "- One limitation is an inability to control for park factors within this data. For example, the Colorado Rockies play in Denver which is at altitude and thus ball movement is affected. This means, anecdotally, hitters tend to display more power in Colorado and pitchers tend to struggle more. Data in other research definitely supports this, but it will be interesting to see how that shows up in our analysis. Depending on what statistics we use, it is possible that these stats will balance out within the team data, but looking at isolated hitting and pitching stats we would see more extremes since the Rockies play half their games in their own ballpark. Less extreme park effects may also come into play since some parks are termed \"pitcher\" parks and others are referred to as \"hitter\" parks ([\"Ranking MLB's Most Hitter-Friendly Ballparks, by the Numbers\"](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2022901-ranking-mlbs-most-hitter-friendly-ballparks-by-the-numbers)). This actually could be something to look deeper into our data for just to see how real these terms are when applied to teams like the Milwaukee Brewers. But a team like the Brewers who play in Miller Park, which is considered a good hitter park, might want to focus more on developing a strong offense where as a team in a pitcher park might want to develop a strong rotation. Or perhaps since both sides are affected by these it wouldn't matter. This might mean that some teams should take our conclusions with a grain of salt if perhaps their home ballpark is better suited for hitters/pitchers. Regardless, it seems that park factors may limit our ability to distinguish some trends across teams.\n",
    "- We also don't have any data about strength of schedule. This means that we won't be able to account for offense being suppressed because a team may have had to play against a particularly strong pitching rotation more often than a weak pitching rotation. To give an example from this year the San Diego Padres will have to play against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have one of the best starting rotations in MLB right now, a lot more than they will play the Baltimore Orioles, who really don't have that stellar of a starting rotation at the moment. This also would apply to pitchers facing particularly formidable line ups. That being said, we are looking at a lot of teams and MLB does try to create even schedules for teams, so the hope would be that this would balance out across our data. Nevertheless that is an assumption we are making.\n",
    "- A third limitation ties into the limitation above about strength of schedule but it is more just the nature of how MLB schedules are built in terms of the teams that you play (strength of those teams aside). Teams play a plurality of their games within their own division and a majority of games (including that plurality) within their own league ([wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_schedule)). MLB is divided into two leagues, the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). The leagues are essentially the same, but in the AL they have a designated hitter (DH) who bats for the pitcher whereas in the NL the pitcher still bats (for now - this will probably change in the coming seasons). This means that on average we would expect AL teams to probably net more offense, but we should still be able to get an idea of relative strength of offense/defense within a team. Also although this effect is noticeable, it shouldn't be so big that we can't say anything about the importance of offense vs. pitching vs. fielding for an MLB team. When an AL team plays an NL team, they obviously abide by the same rules (i.e., they both have a DH or neither does) depending on who the home team is. That means that there isn't any disparity within a game. That being said, the above still holds that we may see AL teams tend to have more offense and NL teams tend to have more dominant pitching. Still this effect shouldn't be overpowering and we should still be able to tell whether offense or defense is more valuable. Also within teams own trends, this won't really matter with the exception of the Houston Astros who did switch to the AL in 2013 ([wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros))."
